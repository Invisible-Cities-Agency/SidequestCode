        "description": "Merge the legacy CodeQualityOrchestrator and enhanced OrchestratorService into a single unified orchestration system that eliminates code duplication while supporting both custom TypeScript/ESLint script detection and SQLite persistence.",
        "details": "This architectural consolidation task involves several key implementation steps:\n\n1. **Architecture Analysis**: Audit both CodeQualityOrchestrator and OrchestratorService to identify overlapping functionality, unique features, and integration points with CLI, watch mode, and PRD generation systems.\n\n2. **Unified Interface Design**: Create a single orchestrator interface that combines the best features of both systems:\n   - Custom TypeScript/ESLint script detection capabilities from CodeQualityOrchestrator\n   - SQLite persistence layer from OrchestratorService\n   - Support for both single-run and watch mode operations\n   - Integration with PRD generation workflows\n\n3. **Core Implementation**: \n   - Design a modular architecture with pluggable components for script detection and persistence\n   - Implement configuration system to toggle between different operational modes\n   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing CLI commands and watch mode functionality\n   - Maintain performance characteristics of both original systems\n\n4. **Migration Strategy**: \n   - Create migration utilities to handle any existing data or configuration dependencies\n   - Update all dependent systems (CLI, watch mode, PRD generation) to use the unified orchestrator\n   - Remove deprecated orchestrator classes and clean up imports\n\n5. **Version Targeting**: Ensure all changes align with version 0.2.0-alpha.1 release requirements and maintain API stability for external consumers.",
        "testStrategy": "Verification approach includes:\n\n1. **Unit Testing**: Create comprehensive test suites covering both script detection and persistence functionality, ensuring feature parity with both original orchestrators.\n\n2. **Integration Testing**: \n   - Test CLI single-run operations with various TypeScript/ESLint configurations\n   - Verify watch mode functionality maintains file monitoring and incremental analysis\n   - Validate PRD generation workflows continue to function correctly\n   - Test SQLite persistence operations including data integrity and performance\n\n3. **Regression Testing**: Run existing test suites for CodeQualityOrchestrator and OrchestratorService functionality to ensure no features are lost during consolidation.\n\n4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare performance metrics (memory usage, execution time, file processing speed) between the unified system and original dual orchestrators to ensure no degradation.\n\n5. **End-to-End Testing**: Execute complete analysis workflows from CLI invocation through result persistence to verify the entire pipeline functions correctly.\n\n6. **Migration Validation**: Test upgrade scenarios from previous versions to ensure smooth transition and data preservation.",
