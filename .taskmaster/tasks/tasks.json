        "testStrategy": "Verification approach includes:\n\n1. **Unit Testing**: Create comprehensive test suites covering both script detection and persistence functionality, ensuring feature parity with both original orchestrators.\n\n2. **Integration Testing**: \n   - Test CLI single-run operations with various TypeScript/ESLint configurations\n   - Verify watch mode functionality maintains file monitoring and incremental analysis\n   - Validate PRD generation workflows continue to function correctly\n   - Test SQLite persistence operations including data integrity and performance\n\n3. **Regression Testing**: Run existing test suites for CodeQualityOrchestrator and OrchestratorService functionality to ensure no features are lost during consolidation.\n\n4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare performance metrics (memory usage, execution time, file processing speed) between the unified system and original dual orchestrators to ensure no degradation.\n\n5. **End-to-End Testing**: Execute complete analysis workflows from CLI invocation through result persistence to verify the entire pipeline functions correctly.\n\n6. **Migration Validation**: Test upgrade scenarios from previous versions to ensure smooth transition and data preservation.",

Run full ESLint scan across entire codebase to generate comprehensive violation report\n2. Categorize violations by severity and type:\n   - Critical: async methods without await, potential runtime errors\n   - High: unused variables, imports, and dead code\n   - Medium: style inconsistencies, formatting issues\n   - Low: preference-based rules and documentation\n\n**Phase 2: Critical Violation Resolution**\n1. **Async/Await Pattern Fixes**:\n   - Identify async functions missing await keywords\n   - Add proper await statements for Promise-returning operations\n   - Convert callback patterns to async/await where appropriate\n   - Ensure proper error handling with try/catch blocks\n\n2. **Unused Code Elimination**:\n   - Remove unused variables, imports, and function parameters\n   - Clean up unreferenced type definitions and interfaces\n   - Eliminate dead code branches and unreachable statements\n\n**Phase 3: Style Consistency Implementation**\n1. Apply consistent formatting rules across all TypeScript/JavaScript files\n2. Standardize import ordering and grouping\n3. Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes\n4. Apply consistent indentation, spacing, and bracket placement\n\n**Phase 4: ESLint Configuration Optimization**\n1. Review and update .eslintrc configuration for project needs\n2. Add custom rules specific to SideQuest architecture patterns\n3. Configure IDE integration for real-time violation detection\n4. Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent future violations\n\n**Implementation Considerations**:\n- Use ESLint's --fix flag for auto-fixable violations\n- Manually review and test all async/await changes to ensure functionality\n- Coordinate with unified orchestrator architecture to avoid conflicts\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI and watch mode functionality",

Execute `npm run lint:fix` to verify no auto-fixable issues remain\n3. Run TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`) to ensure no type errors introduced\n\n**Phase 2: Functional Testing**\n1. **Async/Await Verification**:\n   - Test all modified async functions to ensure proper Promise resolution\n   - Verify error handling works correctly with try/catch blocks\n   - Run integration tests to confirm no breaking changes in async flows\n\n2. **Dead Code Removal Validation**:\n   - Execute full test suite to ensure no functionality broken by unused code removal\n   - Verify all imports still resolve correctly\n   - Test CLI commands and watch mode functionality\n\n**Phase 3: Integration Testing**\n1. Run complete SideQuest test suite to ensure no regressions\n2. Test unified orchestrator functionality with cleaned codebase\n3. Verify Code Archaeology Engine still functions correctly\n4. Test PRD generation and all CLI operations\n\n**Phase 4: Code Quality Metrics**\n1. Generate before/after ESLint reports to document improvement\n2. Measure code coverage to ensure no test coverage lost\n3. Run performance benchmarks to confirm no performance degradation\n4. Document any breaking changes or API modifications\n\n**Phase 5: Continuous Integration**\n1. Update CI/CD pipeline to include ESLint checks\n2.
